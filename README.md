# Animal-decision-tree-classifier

This project is dedicated to building a machine learning model capable of predicting the class type of an animal. The primary purpose is to classify animals into one of seven distinct categories: Mammal, Bird, Reptile, Fish, Amphibian, Bug, and Invertebrate. This classification is performed by analyzing various characteristics and attributes of an animal, such as whether it has hair, feathers, eggs, or milk, if it's airborne or aquatic, if it's a predator, and other features like toothed, backbone, breathes, venomous, fins, legs, tail, domestic, and catsize.
